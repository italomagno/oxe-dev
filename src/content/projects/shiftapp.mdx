## @italomagno/accre-app

I noticed that my colleagues were having difficulty managing their operational shifts, so I developed this app to streamline the process. With it, users can see the remaining shifts available for each day and fill the necessary slots, much like selecting seats in a cinema. As the slots are filled, they become unavailable to other users. The tools I used were Chakra UI, along with Next.js, and a custom database version using Google Sheets and Google APIs.
