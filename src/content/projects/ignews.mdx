## @italomagno/ignews

This was my first complete project, published on 05/04/2022. In this project, I integrated with the Stripe API to manage subscriptions. The blog system allows users to see limited versions of the blog posts. If they subscribe, they get full access to read the entire posts.

- Stripe API integration
- Subscription-based access
- Limited and full blog post views
- Built with modern web technologies

## Features

### Stripe API Integration

Seamlessly manage subscriptions and payments using the Stripe API. This integration ensures secure and reliable transactions.

### Subscription-Based Access

Provide users with limited access to content, enticing them to subscribe for full access. This model helps in monetizing the blog content effectively.

### Limited and Full Blog Post Views

Users can view a preview of the blog posts for free. Upon subscribing, they get full access to read the entire content, enhancing the user experience and value.

### Built with Modern Web Technologies

Utilize the latest web technologies to build a robust and scalable application, ensuring a smooth user experience and easy maintenance.
